# :notebook: Markdown Text Editor

I am currently working on Markdown Text Editor 2.0. It will be a complete revamp of the current Markdown Text Editor, so I am starting from scratch and redoing the entire interface (I am completely overwriting the current files).

One of the new features will be that you can organise your files into folders, and create folders within folders. Hence, it will have a file-explorer panel to navigate your files.

This is the 'nested-folder-system' branch of the project. It is still in development.

If you want to clone the repository, please clone the 'main' branch.
