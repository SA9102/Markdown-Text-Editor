# :notebook: Markdown Text Editor

**Quickly create and edit notes using Markdown, and have them locally stored on your browser.**

:boom: [Click here for live demo.]() :boom:

This app is purely front-end, so notes are not saved remotely. Rather, they are stored locally on your browser even after closing it and reopening it (but make sure to save them first!).

## :bulb: Info

- Notes are stored on the browser's local storage. This means that they do not expire unless you manually clear the browser's data. And even if you refresh the page, or close the browser and reopen it, your notes will be preserved. (But make sure to save them first).
- Responsive and works well on mobile devices and tablets.

This was just a simple, individual hobby project that I created in order to brush up on my JavaScript and React skills.
