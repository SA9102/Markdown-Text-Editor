# :notebook: Markdown Text Editor

I am currently working on Markdown Text Editor 2.0. One of the new features will be that you can organise your files into folders.

This is the 'nested-folder-system' branch of the project. It is still in development.

If you want to clone the repository, please clone the 'main' branch.
