# :hammer_and_wrench: :notebook: Markdown Text Editor 2.0 
**This is the branch where I am working on the new version of Markdown Text Editor.**

**Currently, it contains a simple file explorer system. It features CRUD operations for both files and folders. You can create folders within folders. *To open a file, double-click on it.* When you open a new file, a 'recent file' tab will appear, allowing you to quickly naivgate back to that file by clicking on it.**

**Only very minimal CSS has been added to the program right now.**

## :sparkles: New Features

These are the **main** features that I am planning to implement in the new version:

### Simple File Explorer

Users can use the file explorer to organise their files into folders. They can also create 'infinitely' nested folders within folders. At least for right now, the file explorer will be relatively simple.

### Recent File Tabs

When a user opens a new file, a tab will appear which the user can click on to quickly navigate back to that file (just like in IDEs).

### Permanent Storage of Files

Users can create an account, and so will be able to permanently save their files to a database. This means they can access their files from any machine.

### Customisation

Much like an IDE, users will be able to customise parts of the interface such as the editor and viewer fonts. The program will also feature light and dark modes.


## :package: More Features

The following features won't be in the first version of Markdown Text Editor 2.0. However, they *may* be in future versions.

- Search for given phrases within a file
- Find files that contain given phrases
- Move files to other folders

## Update Log

### 4th April 2024

- Simple file explorer added.
- Fixed bug where the Markdown viewer was not showing, and also a bug where the file tabs would not be removed correctly when a file or a folder was deleted.
